# Enron-Analysis
The goal of this project is to dig deeper into fraud analysis and learn from one of the largest fraud dilemmas in the business world.  We will create a machine learning model to building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. We will begin by extracting our dataset (as a PKL file) and storing it in a S3 bucket on AWS. We will then utilize RDS as our database, while setting it to be made public. Using this endpoint, we will connect our dataset to Zepl where we will work with our dataset to read and implement Pandas to create dataframes to better analyze the dataset. NOTE: In the event this does not work, we will be loading provided pkl files into a pandas dataframe using Jupyter Notebook.
